This cheat unlocks a full **ESP system** that shows you **enemy positions**, health, names, weapons, distance, direction, and more — even through walls, smokes, and flashes. Whether you're fragging in ranked or just messing around in unrated, a wallhack is the most OP info tool in the game. 🎮

## 👁️ What Is a Valorant Wallhack?

A wallhack (also known as **ESP – Extra Sensory Perception**) lets you see other players through surfaces. It adds glowing outlines, skeletons, boxes, or full data overlays to show you exactly where every enemy is hiding.

Even when they’re holding corners or playing off-angle, you’ll pre-aim and pre-fire like a god. And yes — it works even through Viper walls and Astra smokes. 😎
